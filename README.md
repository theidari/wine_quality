# Introduction

The goal of this machine learning project is to predict the quality of a wine from features describing its physical chemistry. While wineries conduct both chemical analyis and wine tastings to analyze their wine, the impact of the entire chemistry on taste is not commonly measured. With machine learning the goal is to bridge this gap, and highlight patterns and relationships that may not be apparent. This could be use or support wineries in their quality assurance or wine tasting, hopefully bringing some helpful new insight to lead to better tasting wine.
